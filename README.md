> A macroeconomia é um ramo da ciência econômica que estuda o comportamento de uma economia como um todo. Dessa forma, os macroeconomistas buscam entender os fenômenos econômicos formulando modelos agredados (representações simplificadas da realidade), eles são agregados, porque parte-se do pressuposto de que o todo é mais complexo do que a soma das partes, não sendo possível descrever uma economia por meio de modelos para todas as empresas e indivíduos inseridos nela. Sendo assim, sua preocupação sempre será em analisar indicadores agregados, como: PIB, taxa de desemprego, índices de preços e entre outros.

### Initial Concepts
- Ceteris paribus -> "all else is constant", that is, nothing changes except the factor or factors being studied
- Endogenous variable -> also called dependent, is the variable whose values ​​are determined in the model
- Exogenous variable -> also called independent, is the variable whose values ​​are determined outside the model
- Flexible prices -> Assumption that prices adjust to equalize supply and demand (long term)
- Sticky prices -> Assumption that in the short term, many prices are sticky, that is, they adjust slowly in response to changes in supply or demand
- Flow -> Economic magnitude of a time interval. EX: GDP (monthly rate)
- Stock -> Magnitude measured at a specific point in time. EX: country's external debt
- Exogenous Variable -> The value is determined outside the model, that is, it is not influenced by the variables of the model itself (independent). Example: In a supply and demand model, the price of an imported input is an exogenous variable because it is determined by external, not internal, factors.
- Endogenous Variable -> The value is determined within the model itself, that is, it is influenced by other variables in the system. Example: In a supply and demand model, the equilibrium price is an endogenous variable because it is determined by the interactions of the model.
  
> Economists, through econometrics (economic theory + statistical mathematics) develop econometric models to study economic phenomena, seeking to quantify, test hypotheses and predict economic behaviors. The economic data used for these models come in a variety of types, and can be:

- Cross-Sections -> Consists of a sample of individuals, companies, countries, among others, taken at a given point in time. Therefore, they are not obtained by a random sample, the data from the units does not need to correspond to the same period and the ordering of the data does not matter for the econometric analysis.

- Time Series -> Observations on a variable or many variables over time (e.g.: stock prices). This structure allows us to determine that past events can influence future events and the chronological ordering of the observations conveys relevant information from one period to another.

- Panel Data -> Consists of a time series for each record of a cross-section, that is, a sample for each set of individuals over a period of time, (Ex: salary history). Therefore, by construction, the units (individuals) of a cross-section are the same for the given period.
